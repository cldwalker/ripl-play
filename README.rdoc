== Description
A ripl plugin to playback ruby code in ripl coming from files, urls or stdin. Also records a ripl
session for playback later.

== Install
Install the gem with:

    sudo gem install ripl-play

To be able to playback multi-line code:

    sudo gem install ripl-multi_line

== Usage

With this plugin, ripl gains commands play and record.

`ripl play` plays its input, line by line, as if each line were input by a user. To play a url:

    $ ripl play https://gist.github.com/725338
    >> a = 10 ** 2
    => 100
    >> a + 10
    => 110
    >>

To playback a url quietly (i.e. you just want to load the url into ripl):

    $ ripl play https://gist.github.com/725338 -q
    >> a = 10 ** 2
    >> a + 10
    >>

Urls should point to raw text except for gists and any github file url
({like this}[https://github.com/cldwalker/irbfiles/blob/master/boson/commands/core/string.rb])
which are autoconverted.

`ripl play` can also playback files or from stdin:

    # Plays script.rb line by line
    $ ripl play script.rb
    >> ...

    # Plays back last 10 lines of irb history
    $ tail -10 ~/.irb_history | ripl play
    >> ...

If you want to share a ripl session for playback later, start ripl with record:

    # By default record saves to ripl_tape. Pass an argument to explicitly name the file
    $ ripl record
    >> :do_something
    => :do_something
    >> ...
    => ...
    <Control-D>

After exiting, the file ripl_tape will contain all of your inputs from that session.
Now anyone can playback that session with `ripl play`:

    # play defaults to ripl_tape
    # Assuming you're in the same directory as ripl_tape
    $ ripl play
    >> :do_something
    => :do_something
    >> ...
    => ...
    >>
